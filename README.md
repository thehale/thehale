<h1 class="post-title">Hello! üëãüèª</h1>

<p>
  üéØ I am a bilingual software engineer (English/Spanish) interested in building
  educational applications which empower people to refine meaningful skills. 
</p>

<p>
  üöÄ As a professional developer for four and a half years, I have built and deployed
  financial ETL microservices which currently generate over <b>$700,000 in
  recurring annual revenues</b>. I regularly contribute to open-source projects,
  with my code running in <b>projects downloaded over 36,000,000 times per month</b>.
  <a href="https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/commits?author=thehale">[1]</a>
  <a href="https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract/commits?author=thehale">[2]</a>
  <a href="https://github.com/thehale/expressive-resume">[3]</a>
  <a href="https://github.com/thehale/github-projects-burndown-chart">[4]</a>
</p>

<p>
  üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI learn new technologies quickly, usually building a major production
  application within one to three months of completing my first tutorial.
  At work, this has included a <b>Docker</b> deployment of a <b>Python</b>
  application and an <b>OAuth/OIDC</b> implementation to support corporate
  Single Sign-On. At home, this includes my <a
  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.jhale.binaryclock">Binary
  Clock app</a> written in <b>JavaScript</b> using <b>React Native</b>.
</p>

<p>
   üìö As an undergraduate Software Engineering student at Arizona State University
   I <a href="https://github.com/thehale/DIY-Smartcube">published an <b>honors
   thesis</b></a> detailing an invention which converts a normal Rubik's Cube into a
   smartcube to track each face turn. I completed my Master's Degree in May 2023 where
   I studied software engineering, particularly agile practices, and researched the
   intersection of mobile apps and smart Rubik's Cubes in my master's thesis.
</p>

<p>
  üé∂ During my free time I love solving Rubik's Cubes (averaging ~12 seconds),
  playing music (piano, viola, singing bass), chasing down a Frisbee in a
  competitive game with friends, and trying out my hand at graphic design
  (specifically logo design).
