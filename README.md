Hello! 👋🏻

I am a bilingual (Spanish/English) software engineering masters student with two and
a half years of experience in deploying financial ETL microservices
and creating/contributing to open source projects.

Currently I'm best with Python and Java, but I'm quickly coming up to speed with JavaScript while I work on learning React Native 
so I can build educational web/mobile applications for the benefit of everyday people.

During my free time [I love solving Rubik's Cubes](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProblemSolved-You) (average: < 15 seconds), playing music (piano, viola, singing bass), chasing down a Frisbee in a competitive game with friends, and trying out my hand at graphic design (specifically logo design).
