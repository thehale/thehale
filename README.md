<h1 class="post-title">Hello! 👋🏻</h1>

<p>
  🎯 I am a bilingual software engineer (English/Spanish) interested in building
  educational applications which empower people to refine meaningful skills. 
</p>

<p>
  🚀 As a professional developer for almost four years, I have built and deployed
  financial ETL microservices which currently generate over <b>$300,000 in
  recurring annual revenues</b>. I regularly contribute to open-source projects,
  with my code running in <b>projects used by thousands</b>.

</p>

<p>
  🏃‍♂️I learn new technologies quickly, usually building a major production
  application within three months. At work, this has included a <b>Docker</b>
  deployment of a <b>Python</b> application and an <b>OAuth/OIDC</b>
  implementation to support corporate Single Sign-On. At home, this
  includes my

  Clock app</a> written in <b>JavaScript</b> using <b>React Native</b>.
</p>

<p>
   📚 As an undergraduate Software Engineering student at Arizona State University
   I <a href="https://github.com/thehale/DIY-Smartcube">published an <b>honors
   thesis</b></a> detailing an invention which converts a normal Rubik's Cube into a
   smartcube to track each face turn. I will complete my Master's Degree in May 2023.
</p>

<p>
  🎶 During my free time I love solving Rubik's Cubes (averaging ~12 seconds),
  playing music (piano, viola, singing bass), chasing down a Frisbee in a
  competitive game with friends, and trying out my hand at graphic design
  (specifically logo design).
